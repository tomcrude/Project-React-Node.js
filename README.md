Start the project:

.Clone the repository or download it.

.Go to server/config/config.json and change the database 
credentials to your own, do the same with the .env file.

.Go to the client folder and run "npm i" and "npm start".

.Go to the server folder and run the command "npm i", 
"npm run dev" then "npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all"
and finally run the command "npm run dev" again.

.If you did the above steps, the server and client should be working correctly.

!!! IMPORTANT INFORMATION !!!:

.Due to the deadline of the project, I have not been able to order the
 code very well and the requests that the client makes to the server are
 more than one, I would solve it by aborting the request once it has been made.

.Passwords are stored in the database in encrypted form.

.I have created two tokens, one randomly generated 
and stored in the database and one generated by JWT.

.I haven't used sequelize for a long time, so it is 
possible that the code referring to Sequelize is a bit messy.
